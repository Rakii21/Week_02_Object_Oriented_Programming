# Week 02: Object-Oriented Programming

Welcome to the repository for Week 2 of our Java learning journey. This week focuses on understanding the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java. Through a series of examples and exercises, we explore the foundational pillars of OOP such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Overview

This week focuses on the building blocks of Object-Oriented Programming in Java. The content emphasizes understanding the design and structure of Java programs using key OOP principles. Students learned how to define and use classes and objects, understand constructors and variable scopes, and apply abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism effectively.
